## Collaborative Group Travel Planning Platform
#### Background
Planning group trips involves coordinating multiple people with different schedules, preferences, and budgets. Traditional tools like Google Sheets, WhatsApp groups, and separate expense apps create a fragmented experience where information gets lost and coordination becomes chaotic.
#### Personal Context:
Planning a 2-week Australia trip for 8 family members with remote work schedules, different city preferences, and varying budgets exposed gaps in existing solutions. This project addresses those real pain points.
#### Problem Statement:
- Scattered information across multiple platforms (messages, spreadsheets, expense trackers)
- No efficient way to handle conflicting schedules and availability
- Difficult to optimize routes across multiple cities with time and budget constraints
- Poor photo organization - hard to search memories later
- Manual expense splitting and settlement calculations

#### User Needs:
- Single platform for planning, during-trip coordination, and post-trip memories
- keep track of contact details of accomodation like email, phone number
- open and close time of places users want to visit and use that information to plan accordingly, raise alert if users plan activities that conflict with open or closing time.
- Smart scheduling that respects individual constraints
- Natural language search for photos and information
- Real-time collaboration without conflicts
- Person-in-charge for an activity
- Automated expense tracking and splitting
